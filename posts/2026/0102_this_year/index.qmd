## Reflections on 2025

In 2025, I completed my first-year coursework. In Switzerland (except for the University of Zurich), these first-year courses take place in Gerzensee (I hope to write a separate post about this experience later). To be honest, it was grueling in some ways.

In September, I started my second year as a PhD student. I served as the sole TA for a master's course, where I gave four lectures on causal inference and empirical project management, followed by supervising student projects. It was a rewarding experience, and I learned a great deal. However, I also realized that I hold very high standards for project management---not only in research but also in general workflows, such as collaborating and coordinating with instructors. I want to improve the course management and organization next year. 

Additionally, in November and December, I submitted proposals to two calls for projects, and presented my work at our brown bag seminar.

Throughout the year (especially from September to December), I gained a better understanding of my weaknesses, both as a researcher and as a person---although I have always been aware of most of them. As a non-European PhD student abroad, I have often felt inadequate regarding my abilities, performance, and output. However, I am pursuing my PhD abroad precisely to grow. I need to embrace these weaknesses and work on overcoming them.


## Resolutions for 2026

- Review this post monthly to track my progress
- Manage and monitor my progress using a Gantt chart


### Research

- Submit our current working paper
- Present at a conference or workshop at least twice (one is already scheduled for late January)
- Start a project on bound estimation (an application that can serve as a dissertation chapter)
- Manage RA time and workload more effectively (ensure clearer communication)


### Personal/Career

- Improve English skills
  - Dedicate 15 to 60 minutes every day to study
  - Attend Toastmasters meetings whenever my schedule permits
  - Use AI tools effectively to enhance my learning process
- Improve time management (especially for research)
- Go to bed by 11 pm and wake up at 5 am every day
- Go running twice a week 
- Achieve a sub-4 hour finish at the full marathon in May


### Other Outputs 

- Write at least 10 blog posts (covering research, life, career, and other topics; roughly once a month)
- Publish 2--3 technical posts on my website
