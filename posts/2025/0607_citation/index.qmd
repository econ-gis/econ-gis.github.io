My friend's paper, published in 2023, has already been cited over 20 times.

My own paper, published in 2024, has only been cited twice. The literature is quite niche, but if my paper had been published a few years earlier (first submission was in 2021), I'm fairly confident it would have received 5--10 citations or even more by now because the seminal work in this field seems to have emerged around that time.

It took me, yes, a very, very long time.

(And just to note: his paper was published in a more recognized journal than mine.)
