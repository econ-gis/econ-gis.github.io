Lately, I've been feeling a bit uncomfortable in my work environment.

Let me start by acknowledging that this post might sound like a complaint in itself. That's not my intention. I just want to think through this quietly.

There's someone around me who complains about something almost every few hours. What makes me uncomfortable is not just the frequency, but the nature of the complaints. Usually, they're not about things that cause real problems, reduce anyone's welfare, or make our work environment worse. Instead, they tend to be cultural frustrations—things that are simply different from what they're used to. A common phrase is something like, “That's not how we do it in my country,” followed by “That's crazy” or “I hate it.” The tone feels too harsh to me, and I'm not used to that kind of reaction. To me, it just seems like a lack of openness to difference.

Of course, I complain sometimes too. But I try to stay aware of it and keep it in check. I try to be mindful of when and how I express frustration. As far as I know, I don't complain like that in front of non-Japanese people, at least, and I don't initiate those kinds of conversations. If someone asks, I might say something like, “Yeah, I miss clean toilets and good seafood.” That sort of thing.

This person also tends to react emotionally, even to small things. They get upset or overwhelmed quickly. It makes it hard to respond with kindness. Maybe I don't have to. I'm not sure. But by nature, I can't completely ignore it—unless I decide to stop talking to them altogether, which feels like a last resort.

People often say that you become the average of the five people around you. It's not easy to control who you spend time with, especially when you're living in a foreign country and doing a PhD.

I don’t feel contaminated yet, but I'm uncomfortable being in an environment where that could happen, quietly, and without me even noticing. It's not just emotional discomfort; it's the possibility of gradually absorbing a way of thinking, speaking, or relating to others that I don't want to make my own. Just like how spending too much time around unhealthy friendships can slowly shift your mindset, I don't want to let myself drift in that direction.

At the same time, I know that in western cultures, people are often encouraged to express their needs or preferences more directly than in Japan. Still, I don't feel it's my place to tell someone to complain less. That doesn't feel like my role. If I truly cared about this person, I would probably speak up. But I don't think I do in this case.

Even if I'm right in thinking that “constantly complaining is not ideal for social life,” I don't feel motivated to invest my energy in trying to help them change.

Thanks for reading this far.
