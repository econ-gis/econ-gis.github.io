## Why write?

I enjoy writing short texts every day. <br>
Until recently, I've been using Twitter/X for that. But I wanted a space to write in more complete sentences, without thinking about followers. 

And, I don't want to post on my personal website. There are people who view blogging with skepticism, and since I'm in a position where visibility can shape evaluations and outcomes, I'd rather not draw unnecessary attention.


## What to expect

Topics will likely orbit around:

- What everyday life feels like as a foreigner, non-European, a PhD student, and an imposter
- Empirical work in environmental and development economics
- Spatial and remote sensing data (analysis)
- Efficient/reproducible project management (e.g., Git(Hub), `{renv}`, `{targets}`) that I enjoy
- Notes or summaries from articles I read (kind of like TILs)


## What not to expect

If you find something useful here, great. <br>
If not, that's fine too.
