## Why write?

I enjoy writing short texts every day. <br>
Until recently, I've been using Twitter/X for that. But I wanted a space to write in more complete sentences, without thinking about followers. 


## What to expect

Topics will likely orbit around:

- What everyday life feels like as a foreigner, a PhD student, and an imposter
- Applied empirical work in environmental and development economics
- Spatial and remote sensing data
- R-based workflows and project design
- Tools for reproducible research


## What not to expect

No personal updates.

If you find something useful here, great. <br>
If not, that's fine too.
